# A Personal Portfolio

Create a website using HTML and CSS, JavaScript isn’t compulsory.

The website should be about you and can be styled anyway you please.

 

***The website can include anything you want but must include the following:***

- A ‘Navigation Bar’
- A Hero or Banner section
- An ‘About Me’ Section
- A ‘Gallery’ section that can contain images about you or just images you find interesting
- A ‘Contact Me’ section

***Here are other rules to follow:***

- Your navigation bar must include links to each of the 3 sections on the page

  ​	For example, the navigation would have a link that will take you to the About Me section

- Gallery section must contain 4 or more images

- Contact me section must contain a form although the form may not submit

- CSS file must contain a minimum of 12 different CSS properties
